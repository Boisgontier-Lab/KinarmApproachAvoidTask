function dataOut = KINARM_add_subject_inertia(dataIn, varargin)

%KINARM_ADD_SUBJECT_INERTIA Estimate arm segment inertias. 
%	DATA_OUT = KINARM_ADD_SUBJECT_INERTIA(DATA_IN) adds two new fields
%	(.RIGHT_ARM and .LEFT_ARM) to the DATA_IN structure.  These two new
%	fields contain subject arm inertia, mass and CofM properties for the
%	right and left arms and are used by KINARM_ADD_TORQUES to estimate
%	intramuscular torques. Inertial properties are estimated based on 
%	subject morphometry stored in the DATA_IN structure, including subject
%	mass and upper arm length.   
% 
%	DATA_OUT = KINARM_ADD_SUBJECT_INERTIA(DATA_IN, 'mass', MASS) uses MASS
%	as the subject mass for estimating inertial properties instead of the
%	mass stored in the DATA_IN structure.  
%
%	DATA_OUT = KINARM_ADD_SUBJECT_INERTIA(DATA_IN,... , 'subject_type', SUBJECT_TYPE,...)
%	allows the option of explicitly specifying whether the subject was
%	'human' or 'NHP'.  If this option is not specified, then the
%	SUBJECT_TYPE is chosen based on the KINARM hardware version stored in
%	DATA_IN.  
%
%	DATA_OUT = KINARM_ADD_SUBJECT_INERTIA(DATA_IN, 'mass', MASS,...) uses
%	MASS as the subject mass for estimating inertial properties instead of
%	the mass stored in the DATA_IN structure.  
%
%	DATA_OUT = KINARM_ADD_SUBJECT_INERTIA(DATA_IN, 'L2_estimate', true,...)
%	uses an estimate of segment L2 length (forearm + hand) length based on
%	segment L1, rather than extracting L2 from the DATA_IN structure.  This
%	option may be useful when the calibrated 'finger tip' location was not
%	the tip of the middle finger (e.g. if the thumb or a knuckle was used
%	for calibration, or if a handle was used instead of a hand trough).  
% 
%	The input structure DATA_IN	can in one of two forms, based on zip_load:
%   data = zip_load;
%   dataNew = KINARM_add_friction(data)
%     OR
%   dataNew.c3d = KINARM_add_friction(data(ii).c3d)
%
%	The new output fields (.RIGHT_ARM and .LEFT_ARM) have the following subfields: 
%		.L1_L				- length of upper arm
%		.L1_M				- estimated mass of upper arm
%		.L1_C_AXIAL			- estimated CofM WRT to shoulder of upper arm
%		.L1_I				- estimated inertia of upper arm at CofM
%		.L2_L				- length of forearm + hand
%		.L2_M				- estimated mass of forearm + hand
%		.L2_C_AXIAL			- estimated CofM WRT to shoulder of forearm + hand
%		.L2_I				- estimated inertia of forearm + hand at CofM
%
%	All of these inertial parameters are estimated using the function
%	ESTIMATE_ARM_INERTIA found in this m-file. The default version of this
%	function provides an estimate of human arm inertias based on parameters
%	published by D.A. Winters (Biomechancis of Human Movement, 1979).
%
%	If a custom method for estimating arm inertia is desired, please see
%	the code for this m-file, and replace the estimate_arm_inertia
%	function found within.
